## Major Hurdles
The biggest hurdle in this project was the styling. I have never tried to do a mobile first design and it was challenging to make everything look right on both mobile and dekstop. Once I had something looking right on the mobile devices in chrome inspector I would try it on my old mobile phone with lower resolution and the layout would be broken.

The contact modal especially was diffuclt to style and make it look ok and function on very small screens.

My other major hurdle with this project was just design in general. I am not a designer and am much more comortable in the code. Before any attempt at styling just thinking of a design that would look good was very challenging.
